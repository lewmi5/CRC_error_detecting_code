# CRC Checksum Project in Assembly

This project implements a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) checksum algorithm in assembly language. The code is designed to calculate and verify CRC checksums for given input data.

## Features

- **CRC Calculation:** Computes the CRC checksum for a given set of data.
- **Verification:** Compares computed checksum against a known value to verify data integrity.

## Requirements

- **Assembler:** An x86/x86_64 assembler (e.g., NASM).
- **Operating System:** Tested on Linux. Modifications might be necessary for other operating systems.
- **Linker:** A compatible linker to generate the final executable (e.g., GNU ld).
